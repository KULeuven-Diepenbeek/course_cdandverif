These webpages will guide you through the lab sessions of **Chip Design and Verification**. The focus in these labs lies in Verification, using SystemVerilog.

In the first section <a href="100_wetfeet/">Getting your feet wet</a> the basic concepts of SystemVerilog are explained. The next section [Adding some registers](200_increase) does as it says: it adds registers to the design. [Climbing the OO ladder](300_oo) handles how the object-oriented nature of SystemVerilog is organised. 

After sowing, it becomes time to reap. This is done with [Randomisation](400_rand/) and [Coverage](500_coverage/). Finally, the top of the iceberg is scratched on <a href="600_assertions/">Assertions</a>.

Armed with those concepts, it's time to put it in actions in the [Project](700_project/).

If you have any questions or if you want to discuss certain subjects (with other students or with us), please visit the Toledo Forum.
